Initial load in after user signs in is pretty slow..
We are fetching current data from the DB and then setting state with this info...
However from that point on, things will move faster as we will use local state to display info... info and changes will be pushed to db but the user will actually interact with the local state...
---- this is something I would like to discuss with T ----
